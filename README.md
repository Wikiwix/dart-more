Various extensions that make Dart a better place:

- `cache.dart` is a collection of different caching strategies and their expiry policy.
- `char_matcher.dart` is a model for character classes, their composition and operations on strings.
- `collection.dart` is a collection of collection types (bi map, bit list, multi set, range, and string).
- `fraction.dart` provides exact rational number arithmetic.
- `int_math.dart` is a collection of common mathematical functions on integers.
- `iterable.dart` is a collection of iterables and iterators.
- `ordering.dart` a fluent interface for building comparator functions.

And there are more to come ...

### History

This library started in April 2013 as I was working through the puzzles of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and encountered some missing features in Dart. Over time the library grew and became _more_ useful in many other places, so I created this reusable library.
